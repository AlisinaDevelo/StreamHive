# Security

## Reporting

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please open a **private** advisory on GitHub for this repository or contact the maintainers with details and reproduction steps. Do not file public issues for undisclosed vulnerabilities.

## Scope

This project is experimental research code. It is not hardened for hostile networks; treat deployments accordingly.

## Transport Security And Identity

StreamHive can wrap peer connections in TLS:

- `-tls-cert` and `-tls-key` enable TLS on the listener.
- `-tls-ca` and `-tls-server-name` enable outbound certificate verification.
- `-tls-insecure-skip-verify` is for local development only.

Library users can configure `p2p.TCPTransport.TLSServerConfig` and
`p2p.TCPTransport.TLSClientConfig` directly. Use `tls.Config.ClientAuth`,
`ClientCAs`, and client certificates when you need mTLS.

TLS protects the TCP channel and, when configured with CA verification, authenticates the
certificate presented by the peer. StreamHive does not yet have application-level peer
identity, authorization, ACLs, or signed replication messages. Do not expose the P2P
port to untrusted networks without a deployment-level trust boundary.

## Dependency scanning

CI runs `govulncheck ./...` on each push and pull request to `main`.

## SBOM

The `sbom` CI job emits a CycloneDX JSON bill of materials (`sbom.cdx.json`) as a workflow artifact for supply-chain review.
