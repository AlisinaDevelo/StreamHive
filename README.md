# StreamHive

[![CI](https://github.com/AliSinaDevelo/StreamHive/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AliSinaDevelo/StreamHive/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

StreamHive is a **Go library and CLI** for experimenting with distributed, content-addressed storage. It ships a production-minded **TCP transport** (context-aware listen/dial, TLS hooks, framing, metrics, limits), a **length-prefixed wire format** (`SHV1`), a typed **blob replication protocol**, memory and file-backed **blob stores**, and operational endpoints (`/livez`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`, `/metrics/prometheus`).

**Semver:** public API versions are tracked in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [internal/version/version.go](internal/version/version.go) (currently **v0.4.0**, pre-1.0).

**Status:** networking, framing, local storage, content-addressed blob keys, static-peer replication, startup anti-entropy sync, durable stores, and Prometheus metrics are implemented. `storage.FileStore` provides durable local blobs for library users and CLI receivers via `-store-dir`. Conflict resolution and global discovery are not implemented. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or newer
- Optional: [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) for `make lint`
- Optional: Docker for [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)

## Quickstart

```bash
go test ./...
go run . -version
make run
./bin/fs -listen :7070 -dial 127.0.0.1:8080
./bin/fs -listen 127.0.0.1:0 -health 127.0.0.1:8080   # HTTP live/ready/metrics
```

### Two-node replication demo

Terminal 1: start a receiver with framed replication and metrics.

```bash
go run . -listen 127.0.0.1:7070 -replicate -health 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Terminal 2: dial the receiver and send one blob.

```bash
go run . -listen 127.0.0.1:0 -dial 127.0.0.1:7070 -put-content-key -put-data "hello streamhive" -exit-after-put
```

Inspect counters:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/metrics
```

Look for `replication_blobs_stored`, `replication_bytes_stored`, duplicate counters, and transport frame counters. The sender derives the blob key from `SHA-256(put-data)` when `-put-content-key` is set; receivers verify SHA-256-shaped keys before storing. Use `/metrics` for JSON or `/metrics/prometheus` for Prometheus text format.

Or run the whole flow:

```bash
make demo-replication
```

For a 3-node Docker Compose demo with durable stores and node restart rehydration:

```bash
make demo-compose
```

For a 3-node corruption repair demo that deletes node3's durable blob and waits for periodic anti-entropy to restore it:

```bash
make demo-repair
```

For a longer-lived node with static peers, use `-peers` and reconnect backoff:

```bash
go run . -listen 127.0.0.1:7071 -peers 127.0.0.1:7070,127.0.0.1:7072 -peer-reconnect
```

`-peer-reconnect` retries only `-peers` targets. `-dial` stays a one-shot connection attempt for scripts and tests.

When both sides run with `-replicate`, peers advertise local keys on connect and send missing blobs to each other. This startup anti-entropy path works with memory storage and durable `-store-dir` receivers.

For long-running nodes, add periodic inventory sync:

```bash
go run . -listen 127.0.0.1:7071 -replicate -store-dir ./streamhive-data -peers 127.0.0.1:7070 -peer-reconnect -sync-interval 30s
```

To persist replicated blobs on the receiver, add `-store-dir`:

```bash
go run . -listen 127.0.0.1:7070 -replicate -store-dir ./streamhive-data
```

### Library packages

| Import | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `github.com/AliSinaDevelo/StreamHive/p2p` | `TCPTransport`, framing (`ReadFrame` / `WriteFrame`), metrics |
| `github.com/AliSinaDevelo/StreamHive/replication` | Blob replication messages (`blob.put`, `blob.has`, `blob.get`, `blob.missing`) and store apply helper |
| `github.com/AliSinaDevelo/StreamHive/storage` | `BlobStore`, `BlobKeyLister`, `MemoryStore`, `FileStore`, SHA-256 content key helpers |

Wire handshake string constant: `p2p.HandshakeVersionV1` (carry inside application frames).

## CLI flags (stable surface)

| `-replicate` | Enable blob replication from framed peers |
| `-store-dir` | Persist replicated blobs with `storage.FileStore` |
| `-list-keys` | Print durable `-store-dir` keys as hex and exit |
| `-put-key` / `-put-data` | Send one manually keyed blob to outbound peers |
| `-put-content-key` | Derive the outbound blob key from `SHA-256(-put-data)` |
| `-exit-after-put` | Exit after the outbound blob frame is written |
| `-max-blob-bytes` | Cap replicated blob payload size |
