# Protocol Reference

StreamHive carries replication messages inside `SHV1` frames over a connected TCP peer.
This document describes the current wire contract for operators and library users.

## Frame Format

Each frame has an 8-byte header followed by an opaque payload:

| Field | Size | Encoding | Meaning |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| Magic | 4 bytes | ASCII | Must be `SHV1` |
| Length | 4 bytes | big-endian uint32 | Payload length in bytes |
| Payload | `Length` bytes | protocol-specific | Replication messages are JSON |

`p2p.ReadFrame` and `p2p.WriteFrame` default to `p2p.DefaultMaxFrameBytes`, currently
`4 << 20` bytes. A frame with a bad magic value fails with `p2p.ErrBadMagic`. A frame
whose declared payload length exceeds the configured maximum fails with
`p2p.ErrFrameTooLarge`.

## Replication Payloads

Replication payloads are JSON values decoded into `replication.Message`:

```json
{
  "type": "blob.put",
  "key": "base64-encoded-by-json",
  "data": "base64-encoded-by-json"
}
```

The Go `encoding/json` package encodes `[]byte` fields as base64 strings. This applies
to `key`, `keys`, and `data` fields on the wire.

## Message Types

| Type | Fields | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| `blob.put` | `key`, `data` | Store or replace one blob under `key`. |
| `blob.has` | `keys` | Advertise keys available on the sender. |
| `blob.missing` | `keys` | Ask the peer to send keys missing locally. |
| `blob.get` | `key` | Ask the peer to send one key. |

The CLI replication handler uses `blob.has` and `blob.missing` for anti-entropy:

1. A peer advertises local keys on connect.
2. When `-sync-interval` is set, a peer advertises local keys periodically.
3. A receiver computes which advertised keys it lacks and sends `blob.missing`.
4. The owner answers with `blob.put` for keys it can still read.

## Limits

Default replication limits are:

| Limit | Value | Error |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Max key size | 512 bytes | `replication.ErrKeyTooLarge` |
| Max keys per inventory message | 4096 | `replication.ErrTooManyKeys` |
| Max blob payload | `4 << 20` bytes | `replication.ErrDataTooLarge` |

Empty keys fail with `replication.ErrKeyEmpty`. Empty `keys` lists fail with
`replication.ErrKeysEmpty`. Unknown message types fail with
`replication.ErrUnknownMessageType`.

## Content Addressing

`-put-content-key` stores a blob under `SHA-256(data)`. The CLI logs SHA-256 keys as
hex for readability. On receive, any 32-byte key is treated as a SHA-256 content key
and verified against the payload before storage. A mismatch fails with
`storage.ErrSHA256Mismatch` and the blob is not stored.

Opaque caller-chosen keys are still allowed. If an opaque key receives different data,
the existing value is replaced. If an exact key/data pair is received again, the write is
skipped and duplicate counters are incremented.

## Failure Behavior

Frame decode errors, message validation errors, storage errors, and peer write errors
stop the current peer loop. The transport unregisters the peer and updates metrics.

There is no per-key acknowledgement protocol yet. Repair is driven by startup inventory,
periodic inventory with `-sync-interval`, and reconnect behavior for static `-peers`
when `-peer-reconnect` is enabled. If a blob send fails mid-sync, a later inventory pass
or reconnect can request the missing key again.

## Observability

Use `/metrics` for JSON counters, `/metrics/prometheus` for Prometheus text format, and
`/peers` for connected peer metadata. `/peers` includes remote address, local address,
direction, connection timestamp, and connection age in milliseconds.
